THINGS THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED

The Manager Menu
-Case 1 doesn't work shows null

The Employee Menu
- Case 0 -> debit card -> expiration date -> need a methode that check if the expiration date is in the future
- Case 2 -> missing code
- Case 1 -> customerInfo prints weirdly
- The whole Employee Menu needs to be tested and finished.

The other services
- Case 4 and 5, after completing the loan forms a exception is thrown showing null

The UpdateLoan Menu
- There is no case to update the amount of the loan
- I can't test as there is no loan request

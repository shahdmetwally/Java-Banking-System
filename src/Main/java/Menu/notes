P * (interest rate)  (1+ i)
Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio: Your DTI ratio is the amount
of your monthly debt divided by your monthly gross income.
Generally, a low DTI ratio is a signal to lenders that you
can manage monthly payments on a new personal loan.

Loan term: Generally, loans with shorter repayment terms
offer lower interest rates. A longer repayment term
typically means a higher interest rate.

Co-signer: If you don’t meet the lender’s qualification
requirements, having a trusted family member or friend
in good financial health be your co-signer can increase
your chances of approval — potentially at a better interest rate.

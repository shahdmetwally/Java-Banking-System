Things I've fixed (Jennifer):
Personal number: - fixed the substring to correct indexes
                 - added if-statements so you for example can't be born on 31st of April since April only has 30 days

transfer money: - the users weren't added to the bankaccount hashmap so the money wasn't being transferred but I added them now
                - the output message and error message was also wrong so i fixed that
                - also fixed so you cant transfer to your own account

dates and time: -did not work, in the transaction history it would display the current time not the time the transaction was made
                 so I changed the arraylist of transactions to return a string of the arraylist instead of the arraylist itself
                 thus the date and time gets saved and doesnt update according to the current time

cvc, code: - had to parse them to strings to be able to check if the length was correct but they are still ints, its only in the if-statement
             that it is string

Menu: -fixed so that a customer cant access the employee menu and vice versa by making an enum called "Role" which assigns a role
       to every user and the menu checks if they have access or not

Exceptions: -fixed exceptions so that the system wont shut down when the you input letters instead of numbers

Json: -added a bunch of getters and setters and default constructors to be able to save all the data in the Json file

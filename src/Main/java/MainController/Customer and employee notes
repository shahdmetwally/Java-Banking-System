Employee
When checking an customer account, null is thrown/ There is something wrong with the hashmaps values

Create customer: You can type whatever number you want, however of you type letter for example in the
CARD NUMBER, expcetion null is thrown and the system closes

When you type 1 in the employee menu you should end up in the employee menu again same when you press 3

An error message pops up when you enter a random number, when trying to update customers password

                    message = controller.withdrawMoney(amount);
                    System.out.println(message);
                } catch (Exception exception) {
                    System.out.println(exception.getMessage());
                }

                    String account =UserInput.readLine("Please enter the account No of the recievient:");
                    message =controller.transferMoney(amount, account);
                    System.out.println(message);
                } catch (Exception exception) {
                    System.out.println(exception.getMessage());
                }


               try {
                                   String amount =UserInput.readLine("Please enter the amount you want to transfer: ");
                                   double amount2 = 0;
                                   if (Utilities.isNumber(amount)){
                                       amount2 = Double.parseDouble(amount);
                                   } else{
                                       System.out.println("Please enter a valid number.");
                                   }
                                   String account =UserInput.readLine("Please enter the account No of the recievient:");
                                   message =controller.transferMoney(amount2, account);
